            <h1>Ubisoft NEXT</h1>
            <p>Tonight I'll be attending the <a href="https://toronto.ubisoft.com/next/" target="_blank">Ubisoft NEXT</a> ceremony,
				so I figured it was about time I gave the website a proper refresh.</p>
			<p>The website as-is isn't very responsive (i.e. doesn't work well on mobile), and I'd generally like to learn a little bit more 
			about web-dev - it's an area I know very little about.</p>

                <figcaption>This is what the old home page looks like. Not great.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>I booted up DreamWeaver to start work on making the site scale better for mobile, and a window popped up telling me how to set my Bootstrap version. I'd heard about bootstrap before (and seen it in html source code), but knew nothing about it.</p>
			<p>One look at the Bootstrap site and I decided to give it a try. It's basically just a library of CSS classes with some backing Javascript that helps you make sites that scale properly. There are also tons of example widgets and templates for components to choose from.</p>

                <figcaption>The new home page looks much better</figcaption>
            </figure>
			
			<p>I've added in a section for a portfolio and a place to document projects. They aren't complete or filled out yet, but I'll probably get to it once the semester ends. I'm also excited to write about I'm doing with my car!</p>
